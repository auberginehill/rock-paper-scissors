                        <p>The result of a 'Rock-Paper-Scissors' -game is displayed in console after the user settable amount of delay (defined in milliseconds with the parameter <code>-Delay</code>, which has the aliases called <code>-Wait</code> and <code>-Pause</code>). The value should be an integer between 0 and ten billion. All values under 1000 (one second) are shown without a progress bar, and for instance, a value of 750 results in a slower pace without any progress bars and a value of 178 is a reasonable responsive UX without any progress bars. The default value is 3030, which shows the result after roughly three seconds and displays a progress bar to count down the time and equals to three pre-steps (primes) i.e. 3-2-1-signal. To get the result instantly, please set the value of parameter <code>-Delay</code> to number zero (<code>-Delay 0</code>). To get the result after two pre-steps (primes) i.e. 2-1-signal, please set the value of <code>-Delay</code> parameter between 2000 and 2499 (where the value above 2000 is defining, how long should it take, before the countdown from two commences). The threshold level for the delay, above which additional instructions to cancel the countdown are displayed is defined on line 27 with the $delay_notify_threshold variable (in milliseconds). The usage of fractions of milliseconds with the <code>-Delay</code> parameter is not supported.<p>

                                            <p>"In 手勢令 (Shoushiling, literally: 'hand command') each participant shows one of the three hand signals after a synchronized countdown, which consists of one to three pre-steps (i.e. 1-signal to 3-2-1-signal), has elapsed. It is essential for the flow of the game for all participants (1) to know the number of pre-steps, for them to be certain, on which count the signal shall be released and (2) then to be in the same rhythm before the handsigns are signalled. If at any time the players are not in synch with their pre-steps (primes), it is recommended to restart the game, since having players deliver their throw at the same time is critical in ensuring a fair match. For fairness of the play, it is recommended to agree on the number of rounds to be played before the playing begins, so that each participant will know whether the outcome will be decided in one go or whether the game is in a tournament mode (best out of [uneven_number_of_rounds]).

Movements are performed very quickly, and the game is usually played until three or five wins. The game is customarily played only with right hand while the left hand was used to count the wins. The participants could also follow the alternated ritus of Jan-ken Style, where both participants start by saying 'Saisho (wa) guu' (Starting with a rock), and after holding out a closed fist raise their primary hand slightly, and follow it with 'janken pon!' simultaneously throwing out their move, whether it's a slug, snake or frog. If there's a tie (a draw or 'aiko', if both participants chose the same move), they say 'Aiko desho!' (It seems like a tie!) and repeat the ritual 'Saisho guu, janken pon' in an almost trance-like rapid-fire succession until one player (finally) wins."

For fairness of the play, it is recommended to agree before the playing begins on the number of rounds a participant must guess correctly (or points achieve) in order to win the match ('Micare Digitis' is usually played in a tournament-mode). In 'Micare Digitis' at the same time when a hand sign is signalled also a number, which should represent the participants guess of the total number of fingers shown on the current round, is pronounced (usually a number ranging from zero to ten is uttered). This guess is validated correct or false by the total number of fingers that can be seen. In 'Micare Digitis' ties (draws), where the participants pronounce the same number as a result that is validated as correct, per se, cannot be broken, but the occured 'Tie-Break Situation' is usually resolved by playing another round of 'Micare Digitis' immediately after the existence of 'Tie-Break Situation' has been confirmed. After each round, however, the fingers are counted to see, if anyone guessed the total number of fingers correctly. If one of the participants guessed correctly, that person wins the round, and one point is awarded to that (lucky) player. If no one guessed the right number then nobody wins that round, and no points are awarded for that round. If all participants guessed the correct answer, then it is a draw ('Tie-Break Situation') and nobody gets credit for winning the round, and no points are awarded for that round.

In 'Micare Digitis', when signalling the number three, it might be customary to use a similar hand sign to what is seen the NBA referees using while indicating a three-point-shot-attempt, where index finger is curved beside the thumb while the last three digits remain straight. When signalling the 'Zero' or 'no fingers' in 'Micare Digitis', the extended hand is accompanied with a closed fist in a similar fashion to the 'Rock' in 'Rock-paper-scissors'."

The thumb is usually not concealed by the fingers), the open horizontal flat hand palm facing down when signalling the 'Paper' (which is delivered in the same manner as rock with the exception that all fingers including the thumb are fully extended and horizontal with the points of the fingers facing the opposing player) and a fist with the index and middle fingers forming a vertical V when signalling the 'Scissors' (which is delivered in the same manner as rock with the exception that the index and middle fingers are fully extended toward the opposing player.

            <p>The Paper Scissors Stone Club was founded in London, England in 1842. The charter appeared in Edition 1, Volume 1, of the club's publication, The Stone Scissors Paper. It read,"The club is dedicated to the exploration and dissemination of knowledge regarding the game of Paper Scissors Stone and providing a safe legal environment for the playing of said game." In 1918, the club's name was changed to World RPS Club. Soon after that, the club moved its headquarters to Toronto, Canada. In 1925, the club had more than 10,000 active members, changed its name the World RPS Society, and hosted its first annual championship.</p>
            <p>Starting in 2002, the World Rock Paper Scissors Society standardized a set of rules for international play and has overseen annual International World Championships.</p>

Each of these is referred to as a throw, and which one wins is dependent upon the opponent's throw. If each player makes the same throw, the round is a stalemate, and must be replayed.</p>

            <h4>The Pre-Steps (prime) – The Approach – The Delivery</h4>
            <p>During the pre-steps (prime) ritual it is customary to use 90 degrees motion when counting down the steps. A pre-step consists of the action of retracting one's fist from full-arm extension towards the shoulder and then back to full extension. The Approach is the transition phase between the final pre-step and the Delivery. The Approach begins at the shoulder following the final prime and ends when the arm makes a 90-degree angle with the player's body. Players must reveal their chosen throw to their opponent prior to reaching the 90-degree mark. Any throw delivered past this critical point must be considered a 'Forced Rock' (since this is the position the hand would have been in upon crossing the 90-degree mark). So once firmly in the Approach phase, it is time to shift focus to the Delivery. Since the hand is technically already in the Rock position, it must either be switched to another throw or remain as Rock. It is customary to try to time the possible transition from 'Rock' to some other option as late as possible, so the opponent doesn't have the time to read the throw and possibly adjust to what is being played.</p>
            <h4>Multiplayer Modes</h4>
            <p>A multiple player variation can be played: Players stand in a circle and all throw at once. If rock, paper, and scissors are all thrown, it is a stalemate, and the round is replayed. If one option is delivered by all participants, the 'Tie-Break Situation' is resolved by playing another round of 'Rock-paper-scissors' immediately after the existence of 'Tie-Break Situation' has been confirmed. If two throws are present, all players with the losing throw are eliminated. The play continues until only the winner remains.</p>

            <h4>Micare Digitis ('Flashing Fingers' or Counting Fingers)</h4>
            <p>In Latin the verb '<i>mico</i>' strictly means, 'to have a tremulous motion imparted'. '<i>Micare digitis</i>' properly meant 'to flash with fingers' in a game in which two persons suddenly raised or compressed the fingers and at the same moment each guessed the total number of fingers raised. It was practised both as a game of chance and as a mode of deciding doubtful matters. This game later evolved into '<i>mora</i>' or '<i>morra</i>', which is still played in Italy today.</p>
            <p>In antiquity within the Roman cultural sphere, there was a commonly used proverb said of a thoroughly honest person, which centered around the concept of '<i>micare digitis</i>' (<i>dignus est, quicum in tenebris mices</i> – 'So honest is this person, that in the shadows could you play the game of '<i>micare digitis</i>' with him'), since it would be so easy to cheat in this game when played in the dark. Usually this proverb was used to describe men, however, since in its earliest forms '<i>micare digitis</i>' was almost exlusively played only by men.</p>
