                    <li>
                        <h5>Parameter <code>-Delay</code></h5>
                        <p>The result of a 'Rock-Paper-Scissors' -game is displayed in console after the user settable amount of delay (defined in milliseconds with the parameter <code>-Delay</code>, which has the aliases called <code>-Wait</code> and <code>-Pause</code>). The value should be an integer between 0 and ten billion. All values under 1000 (one second) are shown without a progress bar, and for instance, a value of 750 results in a slower pace without any progress bars and a value of 178 is a reasonable responsive UX without any progress bars. The default value is 3030, which shows the result after roughly three seconds and displays a progress bar to count down the time and equals to three pre-steps (primes) i.e. 3-2-1-signal. To get the result instantly, please set the value of parameter <code>-Delay</code> to number zero (<code>-Delay 0</code>). To get the result after two pre-steps (primes) i.e. 2-1-signal, please set the value of <code>-Delay</code> parameter between 2000 and 2499 (where the value above 2000 is defining, how long should it take, before the countdown from two commences). The threshold level for the delay, above which additional instructions to cancel the countdown are displayed is defined on line 27 with the $delay_notify_threshold variable (in milliseconds). The usage of fractions of milliseconds with the <code>-Delay</code> parameter is not supported.<p>

                        <h5>Parameter <code>-Audio</code></h5>
                        <p>If the <code>-Audio</code> parameter is used in the command, after the results have been displayed a morse code character e (one beep) or a morse code character s (three beeps) or a morse code character 5 (five beeps) is emitted through the speakers and in the case of 'Micare Digitis', the number of beeps equals the number of fingers the opponent is showing. The default audio mode in Rock-Paper-Scissors is "silent". To find out, which sound is emitted when, please see the table below.</p>

Movements are performed very quickly, and the game is usually played until three or five wins. The game is customarily played only with right hand while the left hand was used to count the wins. The participants could also follow the alternated ritus of Jan-ken Style, where both participants start by saying 'Saisho (wa) guu' (Starting with a rock), and after holding out a closed fist raise their primary hand slightly, and follow it with 'janken pon!' simultaneously throwing out their move, whether it's a slug, snake or frog. If there's a tie (a draw or 'aiko', if both participants chose the same move), they say 'Aiko desho!' (It seems like a tie!) and repeat the ritual 'Saisho guu, janken pon' in an almost trance-like rapid-fire succession until one player (finally) wins.

It is essential for the flow of the game for all participants (1) to know the number of pre-steps, for them to be certain, on which count the finger(s) shall be shown and (2) then to be in the same rhythm before the handsign is signalled. If at any time the players are not in synch with their pre-steps (primes), it is recommended to restart the game, since having players deliver their throw at the same time is critical in ensuring a fair match. For fairness of the play, it is recommended to agree before the playing begins on the number of rounds a participant must guess correctly (or points achieve) in order to win the match ('Micare Digitis' is usually played in a tournament-mode). In 'Micare Digitis' at the same time when a hand sign is signalled also a number, which should represent the participants guess of the total number of fingers shown on the current round, is pronounced (usually a number ranging from zero to ten is uttered). This guess is validated correct or false by the total number of fingers that can be seen. In 'Micare Digitis' ties (draws), where the participants pronounce the same number as a result that is validated as correct, per se, cannot be broken, but the occured 'Tie-Break Situation' is usually resolved by playing another round of 'Micare Digitis' immediately after the existence of 'Tie-Break Situation' has been confirmed. After each round, however, the fingers are counted to see, if anyone guessed the total number of fingers correctly. If one of the participants guessed correctly, that person wins the round, and one point is awarded to that (lucky) player. If no one guessed the right number then nobody wins that round, and no points are awarded for that round. If all participants guessed the correct answer, then it is a draw ('Tie-Break Situation') and nobody gets credit for winning the round, and no points are awarded for that round. The play continues until one of the participants reaches the number of rounds won (or points) needed to win the match.</p></td>

The secondary hand is usually used to count the current personal score (i.e. the number of rounds won). In 'Micare Digitis', when signalling the number three, it might be customary to use a similar hand sign to what is seen some of the NBA referees using while indicating a three-point-shot-attempt, where index finger is curved beside the thumb while the last three digits remain straight. When signalling the 'Zero' or 'no fingers' in 'Micare Digitis', the extended hand is accompanied with a closed fist in a similar fashion to the 'Rock' in 'Rock-paper-scissors'.

It is essential for the flow of the game for all participants (1) to know the number of pre-steps, for them to be certain, will the signal be released on third or fourth count and (2) then to be in the same rhythm before the handsigns are signalled. If at any time the players are not in synch with their pre-steps (primes), it is recommended to restart the game, since having players deliver their throw at the same time is critical in ensuring a fair match. For fairness of the play, it is recommended to agree on the number of rounds to be played before the playing begins, so that each participant will know whether the outcome will be decided in one go or whether the game is in a tournament mode (best out of [uneven_number_of_rounds]). The released hand signs each have an inherent value in which one sign will always be better than the released hand sign and another hand sign will be worse than the released hand sign – furthermore it is ordained that all the signs together are valued successively so that they form an 'Infinite Loop of Betterness'. In 'Rock-paper-scissors' this loop is formed by valuing the hand signals as follows:</p>

The thumb is usually not concealed by the fingers), the open horizontal flat hand palm facing down when signalling the 'Paper' (which is delivered in the same manner as rock with the exception that all fingers including the thumb are fully extended and horizontal with the points of the fingers facing the opposing player) and a fist with the index and middle fingers forming a vertical V when signalling the 'Scissors' (which is delivered in the same manner as rock with the exception that the index and middle fingers are fully extended toward the opposing player. It is considered good form to angle the topmost finger upwards and the lower finger downwards in order to create a roughly 30-45 degree angle between the two digits and thus mimic a pair of scissors).

            <p>The Paper Scissors Stone Club was founded in London, England in 1842. The charter appeared in Edition 1, Volume 1, of the club's publication, The Stone Scissors Paper. It read,"The club is dedicated to the exploration and dissemination of knowledge regarding the game of Paper Scissors Stone and providing a safe legal environment for the playing of said game." In 1918, the club's name was changed to World RPS Club. Soon after that, the club moved its headquarters to Toronto, Canada. In 1925, the club had more than 10,000 active members, changed its name the World RPS Society, and hosted its first annual championship.</p>
            <p>Starting in 2002, the World Rock Paper Scissors Society standardized a set of rules for international play and has overseen annual International World Championships.</p>

            <p>The basics of the game consist of each player shaking a fist a number of times ("priming") and then extending the same hand in a fist ✊ ("rock"), out flat ✋ ("paper"), or with the index and middle fingers extended ✌️ ("scissors"). Each of these is referred to as a throw, and which one wins is dependent upon the opponent's throw. If each player makes the same throw, the round is a stalemate, and must be replayed.</p>

            <h4>The Pre-Steps (prime) – The Approach – The Delivery</h4>
            <p>During the pre-steps (prime) ritual it is customary to use 90 degrees motion when counting down the steps. A pre-step consists of the action of retracting one's fist from full-arm extension towards the shoulder and then back to full extension. The Approach is the transition phase between the final pre-step and the Delivery. The Approach begins at the shoulder following the final prime and ends when the arm makes a 90-degree angle with the player's body. Players must reveal their chosen throw to their opponent prior to reaching the 90-degree mark. Any throw delivered past this critical point must be considered a 'Forced Rock' (since this is the position the hand would have been in upon crossing the 90-degree mark). So once firmly in the Approach phase, it is time to shift focus to the Delivery. Since the hand is technically already in the Rock position, it must either be switched to another throw or remain as Rock. It is customary to try to time the possible transition from 'Rock' to some other option as late as possible, so the opponent doesn't have the time to read the throw and possibly adjust to what is being played.</p>
            <p>Analyzing what happens in the Approach phase lays in the heart of 'Rock-paper-scissors' and judging the events occuring during that penultimate phase for the most part decides the fairness of the gameplay. While it seems, that <a href="http://www.k2.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/fusion/Janken/index-e.html">this 1 ms machine</a> has a 100 % win rate against any human opponent, it actually is throwing "forced rocks" every time (even in its second version), since the decision, what signal should be shown, is made by the machine after the artificial hand has reached its lowest position, which could resemble the 90-degree angle with its human opponents. This 1-ms-responce-time-machine can be beaten every time by throwing a paper against it and declaring that its throw should be nullified as a "forced rock", since the resulting "Scissors" was decided by the machine after the artificial hand had reached its lowest position and at the time the artificial hand had reached its lowest position the hand was showing a "Rock" signal and after the artificial hand had reached its lowest position the machine then (quickly) changed its throw.</p>
            <h4>Multiplayer Modes</h4>
            <p>A multiple player variation can be played: Players stand in a circle and all throw at once. If rock, paper, and scissors are all thrown, it is a stalemate, and the round is replayed. If one option is delivered by all participants, the 'Tie-Break Situation' is resolved by playing another round of 'Rock-paper-scissors' immediately after the existence of 'Tie-Break Situation' has been confirmed. If two options are present, all players with the losing throw are eliminated. The play continues until only the winner remains.</p>

            <h4>Micare Digitis ('Flashing Fingers' or Counting Fingers)</h4>
            <p>In Latin the verb '<i>mico</i>' strictly means, 'to have a vibrating or tremulous motion imparted'. '<i>Micare digitis</i>' properly meant 'to flash with fingers' in a game in which two persons suddenly raised or compressed the fingers and at the same moment each guessed the total number of fingers raised. It was practised both as a game of chance and as a mode of deciding doubtful matters. This game later evolved into '<i>mora</i>' or '<i>morra</i>', which is still played in Italy today.</p>
            <p>In antiquity within the Roman cultural sphere, there was a commonly used proverb said of a thoroughly honest person, which centered around the concept of '<i>micare digitis</i>' (–  <i>dignus est, quicum [cum quo] in tenebris mices</i> – 'So honest is this person, that in the shadows could you play the game of '<i>micare digitis</i>' with him'), since it would be so easy to cheat in this game when played in the dark.</p>

                                    <p>Read Ptolemy Hephaestion, New History, intended for scholarship in six books, a work really useful for those who undertake to attempt erudition in history; it can, in fact, give the method to know in a short time connected elements, whereas a long life would be consumed in the effort of locating them in the books through which they are scattered. It abounds in extraordinary and badly imagined information; and the peak of absurdity is that he attempts, for certain trivial fables, to explain the reasons for their appearance.

                                    <br />As for the collector who has assembled these stories, he is a somewhat credulous spirit, inclined to boastfulness and who has no other distinction in his language. He dedicates his work to a certain Tertulla whom he celebrates as his "lady" and whose love for letters and scholarship he praises. He attacks some of his detractors whom he accuses of having approached the subject in an unhealthy way. In any case, the majority of his stories which are free of things impossible to believe, offer a knowledge above the ordinary, but which is not unpleasing.

                                    <p>a game of chance, combined with skill, still common in the south of Italy, where it now goes by the name of <i>Morra</i>. (Varro. ap. Non. s. v. p. 547. Calpurn. Ed. ii. 26.) It is played by two persons in the following manner. Both hold up their right hands with the fist closed; they then simultaneously extend a certain number of their fingers, calling out at the same time by guesswork the collective number extended by the two together, and he who succeeds in naming the right number wins the game. The <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/adictionaryroma00richgoog#page/n429/mode/2up">annexed figures</a>, representing a couple of <b>Egyptians</b> playing at <i>morra</i> from a painting in the tombs, testify the very great antiquity of the game, and will serve to convey a distinct notion of the manner in which it was conducted to those who have never seen it played. It is the same as that still practised, with the exception that the performers are in a sitting instead of a standing posture, as is now usual; and that they appear to make use of all their fingers, instead of the right hand only, which must have greatly increased the difficulty and intricacy of the game, as it admits the various combinations which might be made out of twenty numbers instead of ten only. The right-hand figure has extended <i>all</i> the fingers of his right hand, and <i>three</i> of his left; his opponent puts out <i>two</i> with the right hand, and <i>three</i> on the left one; thus the number exhibited is thirteen. If either of the parties cry out "thirteen" at the moment of opening their hands, but before the opened fingers are actually displayed, he wins; if neither succeeds in guessing right, they again close their hands, cry out a number, and open the fingers until one of them calls the right amount. What appears to be so simple is most difficult to execute with any chance of success, and requires more skill and calculation than a person, who had not himself made the experiment, would imagine.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />Each player has first to settle in his own mind how many fingers he will show; then to surmise how many his opponent is likely to put up, which he does by observing his usual style of play, by remembering the numbers he last called, and those he last showed; he then adds these to his own, and calls the collective number, thus endeavouring to make the number which he calls. But as all this which takes so much time in narrating, is actually done with the greatest rapidity, the hands being opened and closed, and the numbers simultataneously called as fast as one can pronounce them — eight, two, six, ten — it requires great readiness of intellect and decision of purpose, for a player to have any chance of winning, as well as a quick eye and acute observation, to see in a moment the aggregate number of fingers shown, so at not to overlook his own success; nor, on the other hand, suffer himself to be imposed upon by a more astute opponent.</p>

                                    <p>C'est le <i>micare digitis</i> ou la <i>micatio</i> des anciens Romains, qui n'a pas seulement subsisté en Italie sous le nom de <i>morra</i>, mais qui existe aussi en Chine sous le nom de «crier le poing» (à Émoui <i>hoah-koûn</i>). Il se joue par deux personnes, qui ouvrent en même temps chacune le nombre de doigts de la main droite qu'elles veulent en nommant du même coup la somme qu'elles présument devoir être celle des doigts ouverts; celle qui devine juste a gagné et impose une peine à l'autre. Si les deux joueurs devinent juste ou si tous les deux se trompent, le coup est nul. Naturellement il n'est pas permis de prononcer la somme avant ou après le moment précis ou les mains s'avancent et les doigts s'ouvrent. Quelque simple que semble ce jeu, il réclame beaucoup de vivacité d'esprit. En effet le joueur doit à chaque coup accomplir avec rapidité trois opérations, déterminer le nombre de doigts qu'il ouvre, déterminer celui qu'il suppose que son adversaire ouvre en même temps, et faire la somme. Non seulement les deux premières de ces opérations supposent de la finesse psychologique, la première, pour déjouer l'adversaire, et la seconde, pour le pénétrer; mais encore les coups se succèdent avec une grande rapidité, souvent avec des intervalles de moins d'une seconde, et pourtant chaque joueur a le plus grand intérêt à contrôler chaque coup. Il faut donc avoir l'œil aussi bien que l'esprit en alerte, d'autant plus que si celui qui gagne ne s'en aperçoit pas, son adversaire se gardera bien de le lui dire.

                    Run the script, play the ancient Roman game called 'Micare Digitis' and display the rules of the ancient Roman game called 'Micare Digitis' and don't display the result until five seconds have passed. After the result has been shown, indicate the number of how many fingers the opponent is showing by emitting the same amount of beeps.
